#### This package aims to help you as Laravel developer to speed up package development

This was achieved by placing most of the `make commands` you use in a plain Laravel app.

##### Every PHP class you are going to create using this tool is gonna be `namespaced` with the `namespace` used in your `composer file`.

Personally i just built this because i was in the habit of creating classes in a Laravel project and move them to my package all the time and it was inefficient.
